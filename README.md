# honeycomb-bravo-profiles

Requirement:
- X-Plane 12
- [HoneyComb Configurator software](https://flyhoneycomb.com/pages/downloads).

## Installation

- Download the json file & the prf files.
- In the HoneyComb Configurator, click on Actions on the top of the configurator window.
- Click Import Profiles, then Select File(s).
- Choose the profiles you want to import.
- Copy the prf of your choice to <your x-plane installation\>\Output\preferences\control profiles. These settings will be visible under Joystick tab of the Settings window. 

## Currently Mapped Profiles

- [Toliss Airbus A340](https://toliss.com/pages/a340-600)
- [Toliss Airbus A321](https://toliss.com/pages/a321) (could probably work on the A320 & A319)
Special behavior: These two profiles simplify the autoland procedure of pressing AP 1 & 2 on ILS. To use, just press Autopilot on your Bravo twice on ILS approach.
- Beechcraft C90B (works on the JP_Evo C90B Blackhawk) [GNS](https://forums.x-plane.org/files/file/92114-king-air-c90b-evo-gns-blackhawk-xp12/) & [G1000](https://forums.x-plane.org/files/file/89178-king-air-c90b-evo-g1000-blackhawk/)
- [Zibo 737-800](https://forums.x-plane.org/forums/topic/138974-b737-800x-zibo-mod-info-installation-download-links/)
- [LevelUp 737](https://forum.thresholdx.net/files/file/3865-levelup-737ng-series/)

  Special behavior for Zibo, LevelUp, and Toliss: This profile implements the autoland procedure of pressing AP 1 & 2 on ILS. To use, after APP is armed, press Autopilot on your Bravo on ILS approach while AP 1/CMD A is armed or press twice if both are unarmed. Note that if the approach mode is not armed, like when a lock is not acquired or the runway does not support autoland, the AP button will behave as a toggle between the two CMD buttons.

  This profile also supports the landing gear lock behavior of the 737. To use, pull the landing gear down after gears up all green. This will put the landing gear level in the middle position. To lower the landing gear, pull the lever up then down.

## Some things to consider:
Most of these mappings don't actually map controls on the aircraft. They usually correctly map most of the LEDs and autopilot controls. For the mappings, they're mostly inside the .prf files.

I own a Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick so some of the commands will go to those or the appropriate button on your controller.
